# Send all non-local mail to a single other machine (smarthost).
#
# This means _ALL_ non-local mail goes to the smarthost. This will most
# probably not do what you want for domains that are listed in
# relay_domains. The most typical use for relay_domains is to control
# relaying for incoming e-mail on secondary MX hosts. In that case,
# it doesn't make sense to send the mail to the smarthost since the
# smarthost will probably send the message right back here, causing a
# loop.
#
# If you want to use a smarthost while being secondary MX for some
# domains, you'll need to copy the dnslookup_relay_to_domains router
# here so that mail to relay_domains is handled separately.
